Fees are dependent on the type and length of appointment. For a fee schedule, please submit an initial inquiry as outlined under the Contact page.

I currently do not accept insurance and am therefore considered an out-of-network provider. This is so that I can maximize the amount of time dedicated to providing high-quality clinical care. You may elect to receive an itemized invoice after your appointment to submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Many insurances are able to reimburse you for up to 50-80% of the cost of services. Please check with your individual insurance carrier to clarify out-of-network benefits.
