Fees are dependent on the type and length of appointment. For a fee schedule, please submit an initial inquiry as outlined under the Contact page.

I currently do not accept insurance and am therefore considered an out-of-network provider. This is so that I can maximize the amount of time I can dedicate to high-quality clinical care. I am able to provide an itemized invoice after your appointment should you wish to submit to your insurance for reimbursement. Many insurances are able to reimburse you for up to 50-80% of the cost of services. Please check with your individual insurance carrier to clarify out-of-network benefits.

Cancellations are accepted up to 24 hours prior to the appointment time. If cancelled within 24 hours, you will be charged the full fee of the appointment. If you are late to an appointment, I am able to see you for the remainder of the time allotted for your session.

I am based in Maryland and treat patients located in New York and Maryland. All appointments are conducted via telepsychiatry.
